                                <p class="para1">In the wake of the release of Chuck Klosterman’s terrific book The Nineties, there has been an influx of discussion of Generation X, and how that generation differs from Generations Y, and Z, and Millennials, and Boomers, and whatever other names are floating around that I don’t know about yet. But I do sometimes wonder if having such broad labels spanning decades of time is slicing the bread too thick. I wonder if, on this President’s Day, we should think of this as a matter of Presidents.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Specifically: Who was President were you born? It’s either a four-or-eight-year stretch, and it gives us much clearer, more specific spans of time to deal with. I think you can tell much more about a person by which President’s term they were born under than what “generation” they are. Let’s give it a try.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Biden Babies (Born January 2021-present). These people are literal babies. They have existed only in a pandemic. They’re still shitting in their pants. It’s probably fair to say we don’t know much about these kids yet, except that someday their parents will tell their grandchildren how freaking crazy it was to have a baby in a pandemic.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Trump Babies (Born January 2017-January 2021). The oldest of these kids is still only five years old, so we don’t know a lot about them yet either. Though we do know a lot of them spent kindergarten staring at a computer screen. Also: When future generations look back at this period and think, “wait, that guy was President?” the kids born during this time will be like, “yeah, and I was born during that time! I can’t believe I survived.” I can’t believe any of us did, kid.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Obama Babies (Born January 2009-January 2017). This group, which includes both my 10-year-old son and my seven-year-old son, just minted its first teenagers. I know that 2009 is only 13 years ago, but considering the seismic changes our culture and our technology have gone through in that time, they might as well have been born in the 1920s. I do suspect this is the generation, out of all of these, that is, in 50 years, most proud of the President they were born under.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Dubya Babies (Born January 2001-January 2009). These are now legal adults and, come this month, some of them (unlike Dubya) will be legally drinking. This is of course the September 11 generation, people who only know life during the 20-year panic attack our country has been having since the Towers fell. If any of these kids were to read The Nineties, it would feel essentially like reading about the Civil War.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Clinton Babies (Born January 1993-January 2001). Check it out, millennials: You’re all about to turn 30. Suck on that. Have you noticed how you’re drifting out of the target demo now? Welcome to our world. If you were born in the first term of the Clinton administration, you are now old enough to run for the House of Representatives. Madison Cawthorne, born in 1995, actually is in the House, though only officially.</p>
                                <p class="para1">George H.W. Babies (Born January 1989-January 1993). These are the last people to live in the wake of the cold war, and also the ones who never saw Phil Hartman on “Saturday Night Live.” They all were the first ones to have email addresses in high school, which is to say, they might be the last kids to remember life before them.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Reagan Babies (Born January 1981-January 1989). If you were in the second or third grade and had to do drills where you got under your desk because someone had launched a nuclear weapon, you might be a Reagan baby. Also, you people are all about to turn 40, which is to say everyone is about to stop caring what you think too.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Carter Babies (Born January 1977-January 1981). This is right on the Generation X/Y border, though, again, they’re all over 40 now, so there’s no real important distinction to be made. These people all started college without email and they have no idea how to use Tik-Tok, though they’re probably still trying.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Ford Babies (Born August 1974-January 1977). This is a shorter-term, and it’s tough to find as many people who happened to cross over into the Ford administration. I am one of them, though, born October 1975. Basically, we’re the ones born under a President that no one under 30 quite realizes was ever President.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Nixon Babies (Born January 1969-August 1974). These are the kids of hippies and Boomers, the ones whose parents were surely losing their minds about bringing kids into this world at the tumultuous time they did. Which is to say: They’re a lot like parents right now.</p>
                                <p class="para1">LBJ Babies (Born November 1963-January 1969). The first of these cohorts will be turning 60 next year, which makes them, really, too young to be boomers and too old to be Generation X. That’s to say, they’re much more likely to be into Bruce Springsteen than the Eagles. But still likely into both. For what it’s worth, Kamala Harris is an LBJ Baby.</p>
                                <p class="para1">JFK Babies (Born January 1961-November 1963). If these babies’ parents are still alive, and they could be, they are all long, long tired overhearing how they were sitting in their crib when their parents saw on television that JFK had been shot. “Yes, yes, mom, you were watching ‘As the World Turns,’ I heard all about it.”</p>
                                <p class="para1">Eisenhower Babies (Born January 1953-January 1961). These are still sort of young boomers: The oldest of this group was probably still too young to go to Woodstock. Think Kevin Arnold from “The Wonder Years.”</p>
                                <p class="para1">Truman Babies (Born April 1945-January 1953). Now here are your classic boomers: You’ll see lots of these at car shows, or walking through abandoned malls for exercise. Both of my parents, still alive and healthy, are Truman Babies. Lots of Truman babies had Nixon babies. (Donald Trump is a Truman baby, though only barely.)</p>
                                <p class="para1">FDR Babies (Born March 1933-April 1945). The oldest of this group will be reaching their 90s next year. Twelve years is a truly remarkably long time to be President. Joe Biden is an FDR baby, as is Nancy Pelosi.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Hoover Babies (Born March 1929-March 1933). These were babies born during the Depression, which isn’t going to seem that different to future generations to babies that were born during the pandemic.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Coolidge Babies (Born March 1923-March 1929). Now we’re getting into the deep cuts. If you’re a Coolidge Baby, you are at least 92 years old and perhaps as old as 98. Put it this way: Clint Eastwood is a year too young to be a Coolidge baby.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Harding Babies (Born March 1921-March 1923). If you’re turning 100 this year, congratulations: You’re a Harding Baby.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Wilson Babies (Born March 1913-March 1921). Woodrow Wilson was President for the full eight years, which gets almost all (but not entirely all) of our living people over the age of 100. But …</p>
                                <p class="para1">Taft Babies (Born March 1909-March 1913). The oldest living American, Bessie Hendricks, is still older than a Taft Baby. She looks at Taft Babies and can’t believe the sort of music these kids are listening to these days.</p>
                                <p class="para1">Teddy Babies (Born March 1901-March 1909). There’s Bessie: She was born two years before Teddy Roosevelt left office. She was in her 20s during the Depression. The oldest person on Earth is Japanese woman Kane Tanaka, who turned 119 last month. She’s a Teddy Baby too.</p>
                                <p class="para1">McKinley Babies (Born March 1897-March 1901). If you were a McKinley Baby — like my great-grandmother, whose house I used to sleep over at when I was a kid — you are, I’m sorry to say, dead. Better luck next time.</p>
